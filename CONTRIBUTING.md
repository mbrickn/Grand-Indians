#How to Contribute to Grand Indians

The Goal of this game is to enhance the fan experience. You can do anything as long as it enhances the fan experience and is not detrimental to fans.

##Writing

Kids might play this game so no swearing or explicit adult imagery is allowed in script. If you can be clever and write arround it so that an adult would get but not a kid, that is not just ok, but encouraged.

We looked at what a few Tribes fans liked at the Hackathon and discovered a common interest in Anime. 
Thus please reference Anime and Japanese culture as much as you want to ensure their enjoyment.

Use whatever fonts you like as long as it's for a reason. 
Fonts must have an open licence. 
Proprietary fonts will be *REJECTED* by maintainer.

##Graphics

Almost all images should be .png's created from SVGs. 
Include the SVGs in the source folder so changes to resolution can be easily made in the future. 
If Ren'py ever gains support for SVG's just use those instead.

##Audio

Almost all sounds should be .oggs created from master file or FLAC. Include master file or flac in source. Do not use propritary formats for audio. Proprietary audio formats will be *REJECTED* by maintainer.

Acceptable Music Genres include but are not limited to
* Baseball style music
* Classical
* Rock & Metal
* Electronica
* Chiptune
* Disco
* Polka

## Translating

If you would like to provide a translation that is great! You are great!
It is important for fans to enjoy the game in their native language.
Contact the developers with your proposal and we will probably include it.

##Technical

Target resolution is currently 1920x1080 (AKA: 1080p). A port to 3:2 aspect ratio or 3840x2160 (AKA: 4K) might be worthwile. Do not limit framerate below 60 for UX reasons, and because the internet will have a fit. Do not limit FPS to 30 or less unless you want the Internet to get REALLY mad. The fact that that currently most of our animations don't benefit from a high FPS and that some users will suffer from inefficiencies that running uncapped FPS causes does not matter because market research suggests that telling users their framerate is uncapped boosts satisfaction significantly. Ideally target 144+fps if you do cap it for marketing reasons. Might be OK to include low FPS as an *option* to help users who can't run a 2D game at high framerates.

We prefer that repos be hosted on FSF approved sites like Savannah or Gitlab.
